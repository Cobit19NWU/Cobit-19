  "objectiveDescription": "Establish a common architecture consisting of business process, information, data, application and technology architecture layers. Create key models and practices that describe the baseline and target architectures, in line with the enterprise and I&T strategy. Define requirements for taxonomy, standards, guidelines, procedures, templates and tools, and provide a linkage for these components. Improve alignment, increase agility, improve quality of information and generate potential cost savings through initiatives such as re-use of building block components.",
  "objectivePurpose": "Represent the different building blocks that make up the enterprise and its interrelationships as well as the principles guiding their design and evolution over time, to enable a standard, responsive and efficient delivery of operational and strategic objectives.",
